# CS350-Portfolio
## Project Summary
This project involved assembling hardware components (LCD screen, temperature and humidity sensor, buttons, breadboard, and a RaspberryPi using a GPIO) to create a functional smart thermostat system. The goal was to read
environment data, display it clearly, and allow user interaction through physical inputs.

## What I did well
I carefully followed the lab guide to assemble the hardware components correctly and ensured each step was completed as intended. I paid close attention to wiring, GPIO connections, and setup instructions to avoid errors during assembly.

## Where I could improve
I could improve by experimenting beyond the lab instructions, such as experimenting with alternative configurations or extending the functionality of the system. Gaining more experience designing hardware layouts independently would improve my understanding.

## Tools and resources added to my network
This project increased my familiarity with RaspberryPi hardware, GPIO pin usage, and common sensor components used in embedded systems. It also helped me better understand how instructional lab materials can be used as a reference when working with hardware.

## Transferable skills gained
The skills developed in this project: Hardware integration, debugging, and working with embedded systems, are highly transferable to other IoT, embedded, and systems-level projects.
These skills also apply to coursework involving system architecture and real-world constraints.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
Most of the core code was provided as part of the lab, and my role was to complete the remaining development while ensuring any additions followed the same structure, style, and conventions. I focused on keeping the code consistent, readable, and easy to understand so it could be maintained or extended in the future.
